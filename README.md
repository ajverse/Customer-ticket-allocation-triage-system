🤖 AI-Powered Customer Ticket Triage System : A production-grade, end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for automating customer support ticket triage. This system uses Advanced NLP (Transformers) and Hybrid Models (XGBoost + Embeddings) to categorize tickets, predict priority, and analyze sentiment in real-time.🚀 Business ProblemSupport teams are overwhelmed by high ticket volumes. Manual triage—reading every ticket to decide who should fix it and how urgent it is—creates bottlenecks, increases Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), and lowers customer satisfaction.Solution: An AI system that instantly:Categorizes the issue (e.g., Billing vs. Technical).Prioritizes urgency (Low vs. Critical).Detects Sentiment to flag frustrated customers.🏗️ Architecture & Tech StackThe solution follows the CRISP-ML(Q) methodology and is built with a modular architecture:ComponentTechnologyModel / ApproachOrchestratorPython Scriptsmain_pipeline.pyTrackingMLflowExperiment tracking & Artifact storageSentiment AnalysisRoBERTa-baseFine-tuned Transformer for nuance detectionCategorizationDistilBERTQuantized for high-speed deploymentPrioritizationHybrid (BERT + XGBoost)Combines Text Embeddings + Metadata (Email, Channel)Data ProcessingPandas / Scikit-LearnStratified Splitting, Label Encoding📂 Project Structure├── artifacts/               # Stores trained models, encoders, and logs

⚙️ Installation & SetupClone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ticket-triage.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ticket-triage.git)
cd ai-ticket-triage
Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Setup:Ensure enhanced_customer_support_data.csv is in the root directory.🏃‍♂️ UsageRun the complete pipeline with a single command. This will trigger data loading, training for all three models, evaluation, and artifact saving.python main_pipeline.py
What happens when you run this?Data Prep: Loads raw CSV, creates Full_Text (Subject + Body), maps Sentiment labels, and encodes metadata.Sentiment Training: Fine-tunes RoBERTa-base and logs F1-score to MLflow.Categorization Training: Fine-tunes DistilBERT, then Quantizes it (reduces size by ~40% for faster CPU inference).Prioritization Training: Extracts BERT embeddings, combines them with One-Hot Encoded metadata (Email Domain, Channel), and trains an XGBoost classifier.📊 Performance Metrics (Example)ModelTaskMetricValueRoBERTaSentiment AnalysisF1-Score (Weighted)0.91DistilBERT (Quant)CategorizationAccuracy0.88Hybrid XGBoostPrioritizationF1-Score (Weighted)0.85Note: Metrics are tracked automatically in MLflow.🧪 Deployment ReadinessQuantization: The categorization model is dynamically quantized to int8, making it suitable for low-latency CPU environments (e.g., AWS Lambda, Docker containers).Modular Design: Each training step is independent, allowing for separate retraining cycles (e.g., retrain Priority weekly, Sentiment monthly).Artifacts: All encoders (LabelEncoders, OneHotEncoders) are saved alongside models to ensure consistent inference preprocessing.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
